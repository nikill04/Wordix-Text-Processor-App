REACT FINAL FLOW :
1. Browser loads index.html

2. React runs index.js

3. index.js calls App()

4. App() returns JSX

5. JSX → converted to HTML

6. HTML → placed inside div#root



JSX RULES :
<>
  ...
</>
What is this? => This is called a Fragment.

Why needed?
React rule: A component must return only ONE parent element

❌ This is NOT allowed:
jsx 
<div></div>
<div></div>

✅ So we wrap everything in:
jsx
<>
  all elements
</>
📌 Fragment is invisible. It does NOT create a div in HTML. 
1. Only ONE parent element

2. Use className, not class

3. Every tag must be closed

4. JavaScript inside { }

5. Component name must start with capital letter



An **event** is:
> **Any action done by the user in the browser**
Examples:
* Typing in a textarea
* Clicking a button
* Moving the mouse
* Pressing a key

When an event happens, the browser **creates an object** that describes **what happened**.
That object is called an **event object**.

## 2️⃣ What does React do with events?

React:
1. Listens for browser events
2. Wraps them inside a **SyntheticEvent**
3. Sends that event object to your function automatically

You do **NOT create the event**
You only **receive it**

## 3️⃣ How does the event reach your function?
When you write:
<textarea onChange={handleChange} />

You are saying:
> “React, when something changes in this textarea, call `handleChange` and give it the event.”

So React internally does:
const handleOnChange = (event) => {
  ...
}

You could name it anything:
(e) => {}
(evt) => {}

## 4️⃣ What is inside the **event object**?

The event object contains **details about the action**.

Important parts:

| Property          | Meaning                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `event.type`      | Type of event (`change`, `click`) |
| `event.target`    | Element that caused the event     |
| `event.timeStamp` | When it happened                  |

## 5️⃣ What is `event.target`?
> **`event.target` is the HTML element that triggered the event**

If user types in a textarea:
<textarea>hello</textarea>

Then:
event.target === textarea element

## 6️⃣ What is `event.target.value`?
Form elements like:
* `input`
* `textarea`
* `select`

store user input in `.value`

So: event.target.value   means:

> “Give me the current text inside this textarea”
Example:
* User types: `hello`
* `event.target.value` → `"hello"`

## 8️⃣ How data flows when user types (GENERAL FLOW)
User types
   ↓
Browser fires "change" event
   ↓
Event object is created
   ↓
React passes event to handler
   ↓
You read event.target.value
   ↓
You decide what to do with it

Same logic applies to:
* `<input>`
* `<select>`
* `<checkbox>`
* `<radio>`

Only difference:
* property might be `.checked` instead of `.value`



${ }  → inject JS into string. ${} is used only inside backticks to inject variables into strings
